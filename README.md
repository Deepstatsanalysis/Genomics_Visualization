# Genomics Visualization
In this repository, I am going to write simple R codes for visualizing genomics data. 

## Transcript Visualization
It takes Gene Symbol as input and the output is a plot which shows transcripts, exons, introns, coding sites and other relevant information.

For example, you can see the result when the input is PUSL1 gene. it is obvious that this gene has been located in Chr1, it has three transcripts and tou can see exons and coding sites for each transcripts.
